# Docker Toolbox on Windows Quickstart

The purpose of this repository is to help you get started using Docker and Docker Compose quickly. [Go here](https://mcaubrey.github.io/docker-windows-quickstart) for a list of Docker and Docker Compose [commands that I use daily.](https://mcaubrey.github.io/docker-windows-quickstart)

The setup on the `master` branch of this repository should be able to let you run a container with PHP and Apache, as well as another container running MySQL. After cloning into the respository and getting [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) set up, you'll only need to run `docker-compose up -d`.
